# Week 8:

## Markdown using SQL Database:

Notes:
* .
* .

# Week #4:

## Accounts and Login

Notes:
* Login to protect database
* Sponsor: Add login to different pages
* Encrypted passwords in database
* app = Flask(__name__)
* MVC - model view controller
* __init__(self, name, email, password, phone):
* html files: view in MVC
* MVC - control, view driver
* 

# Week #3:
(Crossover Coding - no TPT this week)

# Week #2:

## 5.5
Notes:
* In some cases, it is ok for you to claim something as your own - must have a license
* Free has a cost
     * If you derive a piece of software with a free license, your work is also free use
* If you add a piece of code that has a free license, then you cost a company billions of dollors for that small block of code
* Different types:
     * Create Commons
     * GPL
     * Open Source

GitHub Actions:
1. My group is using a MIT License for our project.
2. The MIT License is user and open-source friendly and very easy to access

## 5.6
Notes:
* Why is safe computing important
     * To protect our information
* Things to keep secret
     * Social security
     * Address
     * Phone
     * Date of Birth
* Multi-factor authentication to make accounts secure
* Deploy website - find information
* Sometimes its good to post information
* Want people to know who you are
* Be mindful of what information you share on the internet
* SSL
* Organization Management:
     * to organize our own information in our code
     * as we build it up, it will be neatly arranged and easy to read
* OOP and Creating a Class
     * package data structures together
     * Name class - ex: Fibonacci
     
* class Fibonacci():
     * def __init__(self):
          * self.fiboSeg = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21]
* Set breakpoint to ensure that code works
     * Computer stops at where the breakpoint was in your code

GitHub Actions:
1. On college board it asks you to enter an email, your birthday, and other personal information. On my MacBook, I use a fingerprint scanner that automatically fills in my passwords when I am logging into websites
2. It depends on what the webpage is. If the website is a school website, then I would be ok with sharing my information for the purpose of school.
3. A good password has multiple different characters and capitals, it's some very complax that is almost impossible to guess. Another step is two-factor authentication.
4. 
     * Symmetric: type of encryption where only one key is used
     * Asymmetric: uses a pair of related keys
5. An example of symmetrical symmetrical encryption is through card transactions where PII needs to be protected
6. I have made a mistake of clicking on something that was clickbait. I have also downloaded something that eventually gave my computer a malware virus.

# Week #1:

## 5.3
Notes:
* Humans are prone to errors and biased
* There can be intentional or purposeful bias in computers
* EX: Facebook, TikTok, Amazon, Alexa Google, Apple Siri, Netflix
     * Has flaws in detecting accents or young voices
     * Bias certain amount of information on certain watchers
     * Purposeful exclusion

GitHub Page Actions:
1) No, the owner of the computer did not think this was intentional.
2) Computers are designed to be unbiased
3) It's likely that the person who designed the face detecting feature on the computer did not think this issue would happen. It's also likely that the creator only tested the facial recognition on themselves.
4) No, I don't think this issue was supposed to be harmful. Computers are designed to function unbiased and without errors. However, the human programming the computer can be biased
5) Yes, this issue should be corrected so that everyone can be able to access the facial recognition software, no matter what race.
6) I would test the face recognizing with many different people, particularly people of different races to see if the computer is still able to work.

## 5.4
Notes:
* Crowdsourcing- gathering data from a target audience to make improvements to code
* EX: Wikipedia, using API's, forking GitHub code
* All crypto exchanges are checked by 3 different miners

GitHub Page Actions:
1) One way to crowdsource my idea is by using a survey to get input from my peers on the website I am building
2) During my AmLit class, I can make a google form about what are the best books that the students in that class can take so everyone can give my group input on what the best books are in my AmLit class.

# Week #0

## 5.1
Notes:
* Drone functions include search and rescue and recreational uses
     * Can be used as military drones
* Dopamine - the happiness hormone
* You can get dopamine from online services such as games and social media
* Sometimes, games can become addictive
     * EX: Anthony Rosner

1) Easy access to endless information → It can be the wrong information. It’s hard to find a reliable source
2) Provides a source of entertainment → Can become addictive and consume a person’s social life
3) You can meet new people using technology → those people can be dangerous

1) Yes, being addicted to your device is a problem. This is because you are getting an alternate source of dopamine.

## 5.2
Notes:
* Digital divide: some countries have different or restricted areas
     * Maybe have different ways to access internet
* People may have less access to latest technology updates
* Some don't use technology
     * EX: Religious groups like the Amish
* At the start of COVID, 90,000 students in NJ did not have access to computers for distance learning
* In DNHS, we provide chromebooks to every student and have free internet access to all students and staff

1) One example of digital empowerment is to go to a Library or a school where they provide a device and access to the internet
2) An example of digital empowerment is to provide devices and free internet access.
3) Some of Del Norte’s classes require assignments to be submitted online via Canvas. People who don’t have access to the internet are unable to submit assignments on Canvas.
